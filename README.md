Hi @Veglo Houetchenou Gabin & @~™,

I appreciate the detailed document, but I believe we can make the process more efficient. Instead of including repeated "nothing found" screenshots, you can take a more concise approach.

If you find only 5 or 10 products out of a list of 100, while 90 are missing, you can:

- Search using the MFG number and Model/MFG name, if couldn't found, then include a screenshot for reference. Jo it once.
- For other missing products, simply copy and paste them into the document.

At the end of the document, summarize the results:
Found: X
Missing: X

This way, we save time while maintaining clarity. If you come across any unique details, feel free to include them for reference.

Now, I’d like a quick update: How many products were found, and how many are missing? Please provide an individual list so I can look into it further.

Thanks!
